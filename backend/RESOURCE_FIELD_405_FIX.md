# Resource Field 405 Error Fix

## Issue
```
DELETE /api/admin/products/resource-fields/5/ HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed
```

## Root Cause
Django's `APPEND_SLASH` setting (enabled by default) was causing issues with DELETE/PUT requests. The URL pattern only matched URLs with trailing slashes, but the redirect from non-slash to slash URLs doesn't preserve the HTTP method for DELETE/PUT requests.

## Solution
Added URL patterns for both with and without trailing slash:

### Before:
```python
path('products/resource-fields/<int:field_id>/', manage_resource_field, name='manage-resource-field'),
```

### After:
```python
path('products/resource-fields/<int:field_id>', manage_resource_field, name='manage-resource-field'),
path('products/resource-fields/<int:field_id>/', manage_resource_field, name='manage-resource-field-slash'),
```

## Why This Works
- Django's `APPEND_SLASH` redirects URLs without trailing slash to URLs with trailing slash
- However, this redirect uses HTTP 301/302 which changes DELETE/PUT to GET
- By having both URL patterns, we avoid the redirect entirely
- The request matches directly, preserving the HTTP method

## Testing
Now both of these will work:
- `DELETE /api/admin/products/resource-fields/5` ✅
- `DELETE /api/admin/products/resource-fields/5/` ✅
- `PUT /api/admin/products/resource-fields/5` ✅
- `PUT /api/admin/products/resource-fields/5/` ✅

## Related Django Behavior
```python
# Django default setting
APPEND_SLASH = True

# What happens:
# GET /api/resource-fields/5 → 301 → GET /api/resource-fields/5/ ✅
# DELETE /api/resource-fields/5 → 301 → GET /api/resource-fields/5/ ❌ (method changed!)
```

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Disable APPEND_SLASH** (not recommended - breaks other URLs)
   ```python
   APPEND_SLASH = False
   ```

2. **Always use trailing slash in frontend** (fragile - easy to forget)
   ```typescript
   api.delete(`/admin/products/resource-fields/${fieldId}/`)
   ```

3. **Support both patterns** (our solution - most robust) ✅
   ```python
   path('resource-fields/<int:field_id>', view),
   path('resource-fields/<int:field_id>/', view),
   ```

## Fix Applied
Updated `backend/admin_panel/urls.py` to support both URL patterns.

## Status
✅ Fixed - Update and delete operations should now work correctly.
