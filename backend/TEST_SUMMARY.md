## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py test products.test_models products.test_api products.test_integration
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

**Model Tests Only:**
```bash
python manage.py test products.test_models
```

**API Tests Only:**
```bash
python manage.py test products.test_api
```

**Integration Tests Only:**
```bash
python manage.py test products.test_integration
```

### Run Specific Test Classes

```bash

## Test Data Setup

All tests use Django's test database and include proper setup/teardown:

- **Users**: Admin, staff, and regular users created per test
- **Products**: Packages and campaigns with realistic data
- **Orders**: Complete order workflows with items
- **Images**: Dynamically generated test images using Pillow
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others

---

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Authorization Testing
Tests verify that only authorized users can perform certain actions:
- Admin-only endpoints
- User can only access own data
- Staff permissions

### 2. Validation Testing
Tests verify business rules are enforced:
- Unique product names
- Positive prices
- Cannot delete products with active orders
- Field type-specific validation

### 3. Workflow Testing
Tests verify complete user journeys:
- Product creation → configuration → usage
- Order placement → resource submission → completion
- Payment → invoice generation → download

### 4. Calculation Testing
Tests verify mathematical accuracy:
- Revenue calculations
- Progress percentages
- Completion rates
- Aggregations

## Notes

- All tests follow Django testing best practices
- Tests use `APITestCase` for API testing with authentication
- Tests use `TestCase` for model and service testing
- Image tests use Pillow to generate test images dynamically
- Tests are focused on core functionality (minimal approach)
- Tests validate real functionality (no mocks for business logic)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests**: Execute the test suite to verify all functionality
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add tests to continuous integration pipeline
3. **Coverage Report**: Generate coverage report to identify gaps
4. **Performance Tests**: Add performance tests for analytics queries
5. **Load Tests**: Test system under concurrent user load

---

## Test Maintenance

- Update tests when requirements change
- Add tests for new features
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Maintain test data fixtures
- Document complex test scenarios
