### Resource Fields
- Define custom fields for each product
- Support for Text, Number, Image, and Document field types

- Reorder fields via drag-and-drop
- Mark fields as required or optional

### Checklist Templates

### Image Gallery
- Upload multiple images per product (max 10)

## UI/UX Features

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading states and error handling
- Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering
- Modal forms for create/edit operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Tab-based navigation in product detail view

## API Integration

All components integrate with the backend API endpoints:
- `/api/admin/products/` - Product CRUD
- `/api/admin/products/{type}/{id}/resource-fields/` - Resource fields
- `/api/admin/products/{type}/{id}/checklist-template/` - Checklist templates
- `/api/admin/products/{type}/{id}/images/` - Product images

## Next Steps

To use this interface:
1. Ensure the backend API endpoints are implemented and running
2. Navigate to `/products` in the admin panel
3. Create or edit products
4. Configure resource fields, checklists, and images for each product
5. Toggle product status to activate/deactivate products

## Notes

- All components follow the existing code patterns in the admin-frontend
- TypeScript types ensure type safety
- Error handling is implemented throughout
- The interface is admin-only (requires admin role)
