# Public Access Implementation

## Summary
Updated the application to allow public browsing without login, while requiring authentication for cart and checkout operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx - Route Protection Updated

**Public Routes (No Login Required):**
- ✅ HomePage (`/`)
- ✅ PackageDetailPage (`/package/:id`)
- ✅ CampaignDetailPage (`/campaign/:id`)

**Protected Routes (Login Required):**
- ✅ CartPage (`/cart`)
- ✅ CheckoutPage (`/checkout`)
- ✅ ProfilePage (`/profile`)
- ✅ PaymentSuccessPage (`/payment-success/:orderId`)
- ✅ ResourceUploadPage (`/upload-resources/:orderId`)

### 2. Navbar.tsx - Guest User Support

**Changes:**
- Shows "Login" button for guests (not logged in)
- Shows user profile and logout for logged-in users
- Cart button visible to all (redirects to login if not authenticated)

**Guest View:**
```
[Logo] [Cart] [Login]
```

**Logged-in View:**
```
[Logo] [Cart] [Profile] [Logout]
```

### 3. Product Detail Pages - Login Check

**PackageDetailPage.tsx & CampaignDetailPage.tsx:**
- Added login check before adding to cart
- Redirects to login page with return URL
- After login, user returns to the product page

**Flow:**
1. Guest clicks "Add to Cart"
2. Redirected to `/login` with state `{ from: '/package/1' }`
3. After successful login, redirected back to `/package/1`

### 4. LoginPage.tsx - Return URL Support

**Changes:**
- Reads `from` location from navigation state
- After successful login/signup, redirects to original page
- Defaults to homepage if no return URL

// Protected routes
<Route path="/cart" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <MainLayout><CartPage /></MainLayout>
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Login Redirect
```tsx
// In product detail page
if (!user) {
  navigate('/login', { state: { from: `/package/${id}` } });
  return;
}

// In login page

navigate(from, { replace: true });
```
