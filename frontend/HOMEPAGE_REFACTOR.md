# HomePage Component Refactoring

## Summary
Refactored the HomePage into modular, reusable components organized in a dedicated `homepage` folder for better code organization and maintainability.

## New Component Structure

### Created Components in `frontend/src/components/homepage/`

1. **PackagesSection.tsx**
   - Displays the Campaign Packages section
   - Accepts `packages` array as prop
   - Handles rendering of package cards
   - Uses EnhancedProductCard or ProductCard based on image availability
   - Returns null if no packages available

2. **CampaignsSection.tsx**
   - Displays the Individual Campaigns section
   - Accepts `campaigns` array as prop
   - Handles rendering of campaign cards
   - Uses EnhancedProductCard or ProductCard based on image availability
   - Returns null if no campaigns available

3. **LoadingState.tsx**
   - Displays loading spinner
   - Shown while products are being fetched
   - Centered with animation

4. **ErrorState.tsx**
   - Displays error messages
   - Accepts `message` string as prop
   - Red-themed alert box

5. **EmptyState.tsx**
   - Displays when no products are available
   - Shows icon, heading, and descriptive text
   - Better UX than simple text message

## Updated Files

### HomePage.tsx
- **Before**: 100+ lines with all logic inline
- **After**: ~60 lines, clean and modular
- Imports all homepage components
- Focuses only on data fetching and state management
- Delegates rendering to specialized components

## Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used elsewhere if needed
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update individual sections
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Readability**: HomePage is now much cleaner and easier to understand
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new sections or modify existing ones

## Component Organization

```
frontend/src/
├── components/
│   ├── homepage/
│   │   ├── PackagesSection.tsx      # Campaign packages display
│   │   ├── CampaignsSection.tsx     # Individual campaigns display
│   │   ├── LoadingState.tsx         # Loading spinner
│   │   ├── ErrorState.tsx           # Error message display
│   │   └── EmptyState.tsx           # No products message
│   ├── Navbar.tsx
│   ├── Footer.tsx
│   ├── ProductCard.tsx
│   └── EnhancedProductCard.tsx
└── pages/
    └── HomePage.tsx                  # Main page component
```

## Future Enhancements

With this modular structure, it's now easy to add:
- Hero/Banner section component
- Search/Filter component
- Featured products component
- Testimonials component
- Categories component
- Promotional banners component

Each can be created as a separate component in the `homepage` folder and imported into HomePage.

## No Breaking Changes

All functionality remains exactly the same. This is purely a code organization improvement with no changes to user-facing features.
